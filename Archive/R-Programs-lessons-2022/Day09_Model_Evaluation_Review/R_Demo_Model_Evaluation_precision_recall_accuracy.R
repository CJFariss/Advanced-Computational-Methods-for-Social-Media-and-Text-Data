## Introduction to tutorial:
##
## Define: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, AUC ROC, AUC PRC, F1-Score
##
## (1) Accuracy
## Accuracy is the proportion of predictions that are correct.
## That is, how many 1s and 0s did the algorithm correctly classify or predict?
##
## (2) Precision
## Precision is the proportion of the predictions which are "relevant".
## This is the true positive predictions divided by the sum of the true positive predictions and the false positive predictions.
## That is, what is the proportion of true positives predictions relative to the total number of positive predictions from the model?
##
## (3) Recall
## Recall is the proportion of predictions that are the "total relevant" ones.
## This is the true positive predictions divided by the sum of the true positive predictions and the false negative predictions.
## That is, what is the proportion of true positives predictions relative to the total number of true predictions and missed predictions from the model?
##
## Depending on the substantive goal of the modeling effort, the researcher may wish to minimize false positives (See the unit on false discovery) or false negatives (identify all potential units that are of some class for further analysis).
##
## (4) AUC ROC
## A receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) and precision recall curve (PRC curve) are both the predictions of a binary classifier system as the discrimination threshold is varied.
## Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC ROC) is the average of the proportion of true positive predictions for all prediction thresholds from 0 to 1.
##
## (5) AUC PRC
## AUC PRC Area Under the Precision Recall Curve is the average recall proportion for all recall thresholds from 0 to 1.
##
## (6) F1-Score
## F1-score is another measure of the accuracy of a test.
## It is calculated using both the precision and recall scores.

## simulated data
n <- 1000
x <- rnorm(n)

## set parameters
beta <- 1

## multiply alpha by beta (if its 0 it doesn't matter and the proportion of 1s and 0s is always 50/50).
## This is useful for illustrative purposes (see R_Demo_Measurement_latent_variable.R file for more information about the logit transformation of a continuous predictor variable)
alpha <- -1.5*beta

## generate probabilities using the inverse logit function
prob_y_true <- inv.logit(alpha + beta*x + rnorm(n))

summary(prob_y_true)

## generate a binary dependent variable with error
y <- rbinom(1:n, size=1, prob=prob_y_true)

## fit a logistic regression and estimate the probability of y
fit <- glm(y ~ x, family=binomial("logit"))

cor(prob_y_true, prob_y)

plot(prob_y_true, prob_y)

## though we know the true probability, but we can only estimate the probability with observed data
## use the estimated probability to generate binary predictions at a discrimination threshold, often called pi or theta
threshold <- 0.5
y_hat <- ifelse(prob_y > threshold , 1, 0)

table(y)

table(y_hat)


## tabulate the prediction in the rows and the true value in the columns
## these values can go in either column or row.
## the code below requires them in prediction for rows and observed for columns

## this table is called a confusion matrix
confusion_matrix <- table(y_hat,y)

## set true positive and true negative (the diagonal)

## recall
## this is equivalent to the proportion of true positives by all positive observations
## if recall is high, there is a low false negative rate
## if recall is low, there is a high false negative rate
recall <- (TP) / (TP + FN)
