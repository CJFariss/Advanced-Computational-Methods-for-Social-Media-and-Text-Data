## Instructions:
##
## These challenges are meant to be just that, challenging. 
## They should also be fun. I encourage you to think creatively and collaboratively. 
## Getting stuck or not finishing all the steps is expected and encouraged. 
## This is how learning works!
## Learn to program, program to learn.
##
## Always start with step (1) and then continue to each step as time permits.
## Don't worry about completing each step. Document your code for each step.
## You may wish to come back to some of the harder steps as you progress through the course.
## Note that some of the steps may ask you to use skills we have not yet covered in the course.
## Don't worry about these steps now but definitely think through the programming logic if you are stuck and make plans to come back to try them once you feel ready.

## Steps for the Challenge
##
## (1) create a vector of integers numbers and a scalar integer target
## (2) write a program in R that determines (returns) two numbers from the vector that add up to the target scalar
## (3) how many combinations of numbers in the vector of integers add up to the target scalar?
## (4) write a function to complete steps  1-3 (hint: wrap the program from (3) within a function)
## (5) write a simulation that explore the relationship between (a) the vector of integers numbers and (b) scalar integer target sum
## (6) re-write the program or function so that it takes fewer steps to calculate the number of numeric combinations that add up to the scalar target

## (1) create a vector of integers numbers and a scalar integer target
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
y <- 5

## (2) write a program in R that determines (returns) two numbers from the vector that add up to the target scalar
test <- x + x[1]
test == y

x[test==y]

value <- c()
for(i in 1:length(x)){
  test <- x + x[i]
  value <- x[test==y]
  print(value)
}
value


add <- function(a,b){a+b}
add(1,2)
