## load package
install.packages("keras")
library(keras)

## load the dataset from the keras package
mnist <- dataset_mnist()

## examine the list object
names(mnist)
names(mnist$train)
names(mnist$test)

## make dataframes from the list
x_train <- mnist$train$x
y_train <- mnist$train$y
x_test <- mnist$test$x
y_test <- mnist$test$y

## The x data is a 3D array (images,width,height) of grayscale values.
##
## To prepare the data for training, convert the 3D arrays into matrices by reshaping width and height into a single dimension (28x28 images are flattened into length 784 vectors).
##
## Then, convert the grayscale values from integers ranging between 0 to 255 into floating point values ranging between 0 and 1

## reshape
dim(x_train)
dim(x_test)

dim(x_train) <- c(nrow(x_train), 784)
dim(x_test) <- c(nrow(x_test), 784)

dim(x_train)
dim(x_test)

## rescale
x_train <- x_train / 255
x_test <- x_test / 255

## use a keras function to change the dependent variable (target variable) to categorical
y_train <- to_categorical(y_train, 10)
y_test <- to_categorical(y_test, 10)


head(y_train)
head(y_test)

## The core data structure of Keras is a model, which denotes the organization of layers and nodes. 
## There are many types of layers.
##
## The simplest type of model is feed forward neural network, which is a sequential model with linear relationship between the elements.
##
## Each layer is defined using layer_dense() function, which takes as input the number of neurons or units (which are linear transformations from the previous layer) that we want to use.
##
## layer_dense() also takes the input shape which is what the data structure in the training and test set is.
##
## Since we are using a dataframe, we just need to tell the function how long the row is (i.e., the number of columns), which is 784.
##
## We then specify how we will transform the nodes in the layer. We can just use a linear transformation, which is 1 to 1. We can also use other transformations if we want (e.g., rectified linear unit (ReLU)).
##
## Each layer is "stacked" together
##
## softmax is the transformation for linear information into un-ordered categories
##
## The sequential model can have many layers and activation functions added to it  using the pipe (%>%) operator:

var <- c()

## model definition
model <- keras_model_sequential()

  layer_dense(units = 1, input_shape = c(784)) %>%
